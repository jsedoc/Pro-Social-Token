Tzuo -
its basically, how do you decentralize and price positive externalities without a central person decision what "positive" is
Tzuo -
from the note, it sounds like a central body has to decide who the "teacher" is
Joao Sedoc
yup
Well "miner"
And who are the "sinks" that can exchange tokens for cash.
As well the rate of exchange, which will be relative to the pool of investors.
We are quite serious about this.
We'd like to get a white paper out by the end of March.
And setup a development team ("paid with Pro-scoial tokens, by beginning of April
Tzuo -
wow
Joao Sedoc
The organization would be non-profit and the ICO would be to high net worth donors only, and it will be a charitable contribution
Tzuo -
oh ic
then it changes how i was thinking about it
Joao Sedoc
As far as the doers, Anneke and Xiao are in charge of happening the project
Tzuo -
there is a literature on jobs that satisfy ie, teacher, nurses, social workers
and one literature argues that they get paid less
because those jobs make them feel good (its the compensation)
Joao Sedoc
Oh really? i.e. literature, that's great.
If you can send references to the group that would be awesome!
Tzuo -
i thought you wanted to somehow think about pricing that externatily
but this sounds more like, take a donation and then do something with it
Joao Sedoc
well, we need a "sink"
Tzuo -
whats the sink?
Joao Sedoc
I.e. a place where tokens can be exchanged for cash
Tzuo -
and this is different from barter/exchanges because ....
Joao Sedoc
So, the woking plan is to only allow artists to exchange tokens for cash
Tzuo -
who decides who's an artist?
Joao Sedoc
the central organization
Tzuo -
ah
ok, that answers a lot then
Joao Sedoc
so, the central organization decides who can mine, who can exchange, and what is the rate
Tzuo -
so the central guys need to convince donors they are incorruptible
Joao Sedoc
and who can donate to the pool
Tzuo -
can the market make this decision?
instead of the central org
Joao Sedoc
Yes eventually
Tzuo -
that was what i was trying to think about and i didn't have a solution to that
Joao Sedoc
But there has to be first an establishment of "trust"
Tzuo -
because at the end, there is a voter and im not aware of any voting mechanism that isn't who's more able is more right
ic
so for a start, the central organization functions as a decision maker on who has positive externalities
and then, perhaps, the teachers can vote to make new teachers and so on
Joao Sedoc
exactly
Tzuo -
like, those democratice special voters
forget who they are.
Tzuo -
the UN has this other model where they try to implement budgeting
presumably, the issue there is how do you make sure a grocery selling baby formula is actually selling baby formula
i'll can try to track that down as well and see what the issue was
its the same problem
Joao Sedoc
yup! that's the crux
Tzuo -
how do you make sure the artist paints, and the paint is a public good
but again, everyone trusts the UN, except donald of course
Joao Sedoc
LOL
Tzuo -
and they are spending their own money, so who cares if they screw themselves over
