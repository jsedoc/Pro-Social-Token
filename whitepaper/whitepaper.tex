% Users of the {thebibliography} environment or BibTeX should use the
% scicite.sty package, downloadable from *Science* at
% www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/TeX_help/ .
% This package should properly format in-text
% reference calls and reference-list numbers.

\usepackage{scicite}

% Use times if you have the font installed; otherwise, comment out the
% following line.

\newcommand*{\sectiondir}{sections/}

% The preamble here sets up a lot of new/revised commands and
% environments.  It's annoying, but please do *not* try to strip these
% out into a separate .sty file (which could lead to the loss of some
% information when we convert the file to other formats).  Instead, keep
% them in the preamble of your main LaTeX source file.


% The following parameters seem to provide a reasonable page setup.

\topmargin 0.0cm
\oddsidemargin 0.2cm
\textwidth 16cm 
\textheight 21cm
\footskip 1.0cm


%The next command sets up an environment for the abstract to your paper.

\newenvironment{sciabstract}{%
\begin{quote} \bf}
{\end{quote}}


% If your reference list includes text notes as well as references,
% include the following line; otherwise, comment it out.

\renewcommand\refname{References and Notes}

% The following lines set up an environment for the last note in the
% reference list, which commonly includes acknowledgments of funding,
% help, etc.  It's intended for users of BibTeX or the {thebibliography}
% environment.  Users who are hand-coding their references at the end
% using a list environment such as {enumerate} can simply add another
% item at the end, and it will be numbered automatically.

\newcounter{lastnote}
\newenvironment{scilastnote}{%
\setcounter{lastnote}{\value{enumiv}}%
\addtocounter{lastnote}{+1}%
\begin{list}%
{\arabic{lastnote}.}
{\setlength{\leftmargin}{.22in}}
{\setlength{\labelsep}{.5em}}}

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.
