\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

Those who solve the "common problems" are not properly compensated

\subsection{Protocol Overview}

Key challenges: proof of human work, valuing the transaction, and exchange rate among different communities. We need to have an arugment of a permissionless blockchain in this vision. 

\subsection{Value Proposition}

1. Properly Value work that is currently undervalued. 2. Properly measure and store trust. 3. Create an environment of good faith while not compromising privacy, thus facilitating commerce. 

\subsection{Paper Organization}

This document is organized as follows.

% In here we need to discuss the problem: 
% 	- define what prosocial means: giving more than taking
% 	- define how people are incentivize to care only for themselves - the common good problem
% 	- define how to determine if someone is trust worthy = prosocial
%   - define the storage of trust
%  	- Proposed protocol in broad strokes
% 	- potential application and value proposition
% 	-
